Elementor Beta (Developer Edition) gives you direct access into [Elementor's](https://elementor.com/?utm_source=wp-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=dev-edition-readme) development process, and lets you take an active part in perfecting our product. Each Developer Edition release will contain experimental functionalities that developers will be able to use to get familiar with the next releases before they are published.

== Description ==

Be part of our future releases

By installing the Developer Edition plugin, [Elementor](https://elementor.com/?utm_source=wp-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=dev-edition-readme) users can now get a sneak peek of future features before they roll out. We invite you to participate and test features on our Developer Edition. This way, you’ll help us extend our ability to perfect our product and produce experimental and groundbreaking features.

The Elementor Developer Edition gives you first access to Elementor’s newest features and improvements. Each Developer Edition release will contain experimental functionalities that developers will be able to use to get familiar with the next releases before they are published.  We will use this plugin to validate new features and gain feedback before they are released.
This is why we don’t recommend using it on live sites.
We recommend using it on staging environments only, and backing up your entire website before updating.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Why am I not seeing the update notification?**

There are some instances where the notification takes a while to appear. Try to refresh it by going to “Dashboard” > “Updates”, and click on “Check again”. In addition, you can try clearing your site’s cache and see if the update appears.

**Where can I report bugs or contribute to Elementor?**

On the top admin bar, you will see a button with the text ‘Report an issue’. Once you click on the link you will be redirected to the issue template form.

**Where do updates come from?**

Elementor Dev versions are downloaded from the WordPress.org SVN repository. These versions will only be available to your site if you use the Elementor Developer Edition plugin.

**Can I rollback to an earlier version?**

Yes! You can always take advantage of Elementor’s rollback option and revert to an earlier more stable version, or alternatively click “Re-install Now” on the Developer Edition page.

**Is it safe to use Developer Edition?**

The Developer edition is an unstable version and should be used for staging sites only. We advise you to backup your website before trying the version.

**Which features will roll out to the next version of Elementor?**

The features that roll out to stable versions will do so gradually. This means not all features presented in the Elementor Developer Edition will be incorporated into the upcoming version. We might even remove features from this version from time to time based on the experiment status.

**I’m already a beta tester, isn’t it the same?**

Beta versions are the designated version for release. Developer Edition versions will include extra features for testing purposes and will be rolled out gradually.
